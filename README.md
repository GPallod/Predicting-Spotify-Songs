# Predicting-Spotify-Songs
Analysing a Spotify dataset and predicting the popularity of songs

I did 4 main things - 
1. Built a Multi-Variable Regression Model which predicts the popularity of a song, in a scale of 0 to 100, given certain attributes of the song.
2. Built a k-Nearest Neighbour Classification Model which predicts the popularity of a song.
3. Built a k-Nearest Neighbour Classification Model which predicts whether the song is explicit or not.
4. Find 95% Confidence Intervals of attributes like Danceability and Loudness of any song of any decade.

Things to develop more - 
1. Make the regression quadratic, to make it a better fit to the model.
